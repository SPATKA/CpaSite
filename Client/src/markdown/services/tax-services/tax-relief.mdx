**If You Owe the IRS Money, We Can Help!**
------------------------------------------

Have you ever received a letter or notice from the IRS, ignored it, and now you owe penalties and fines on top of the taxes you already owe?  

You’re not alone.

Millions of taxpayers receive letters or notices from the IRS every year. Most of the time there’s nothing to worry about. But sometimes there is. Maybe you owe the IRS back taxes or failed to file a tax return because you owed the IRS money that you knew you didn’t have. Maybe you were recently divorced, and your tax situation seemed too complicated to figure out. Or, perhaps you were just too busy to bother filing.

Whatever the reason, if the IRS has caught up to you and is demanding payment, the next step is likely to be garnishing your wages, putting a lien on your home or a levy on your bank account. The worst thing you can do is keep ignoring the situation because it won’t be going away -- ever -- unless you take action.
